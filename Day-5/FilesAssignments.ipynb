    "# Files, Assignments, and Expressions in Python\n",
    " 1. **Files in Python**: Python provides built-in functions to work with files. You can open a file using the `open()` function, which returns a file object. You can read from or write to the file using methods like `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`, `write()`, and `writelines()`. It is important to close the file after you are done using it, which can be done using the `close()` method or by using a `with` statement to automatically handle closing the file.\n",
    " 2. **Assignments in Python**: An assignment in Python is the process of assigning a value to a variable. The syntax for assignment is `variable_name = value`. You can assign values of different types to variables, and you can also perform multiple assignments in a single line. For example, `x, y, z = 1, 2, 3` assigns the values 1, 2, and 3 to the variables x, y, and z respectively.\n",
    " 3. **Expressions in Python**: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions can be simple, such as `2 + 3`, or more complex, such as `x * (y + z)`. The result of an expression can be assigned to a variable or used directly in a statement. For example, `result = x * (y + z)` assigns the result of the expression to the variable `result`."
