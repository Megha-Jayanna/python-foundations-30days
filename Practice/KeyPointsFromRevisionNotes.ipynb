    "# Why virtual environments is important?\n",
    "Because it allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. This means that you can have different versions of libraries and packages for each project without conflicts. It also helps to keep your global Python environment clean and organized, preventing issues that may arise from installing packages globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to create a virtual environment?\n",
    "You can create a virtual environment using the `venv` module in Python, and there are 3 steps to do that:\n",
    "1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.\n",
    "2. Run the command `python -m venv myenv`, where `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment. This will create a new directory called `myenv` in your current directory, which will contain the virtual environment.\n",
    "3. To activate the virtual environment, run the command `source myenv/bin/activate` on Unix or MacOS, or `myenv\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows. Once activated, you can install packages and run Python scripts within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How many ways to create a virtual environment?\n",
    "There are several ways to create a virtual environment in Python, including:\n",
    "1. Using the `venv` module (as described above). Example: `python -m venv myenv`\n",
    "2. Using the `virtualenv` package, which is a third-party tool that provides additional features and is compatible with older versions of Python. Example: pip install virtualenv, then `virtualenv myenv`, virtualenv -p python3 virtualenv myenv\n",
    "3. Using `conda`, which is a package manager that can create virtual environments and manage dependencies for Python and other programming languages. Example: conda create -p myenv python=3.8, conda create -n myenv python=3.8\n",
    "4. Using `pipenv`, which is a tool that combines package management and virtual environment creation in one command. Example: pip install pipenv, then `pipenv install` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies from a Pipfile.\n"

    "# Basic Syntax/Rules of Python\n",
    "1. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. This means that the level of indentation determines the scope of loops, functions, and other code blocks. It is important to be consistent with indentation, as mixing tabs and spaces can lead to errors.\n",
    "2. Comments in Python are denoted by the `#` symbol. Anything following the `#` on a line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable.\n",
    "3. Line continuation in Python can be achieved using the backslash `\\` character. This allows you to split a long line of code into multiple lines for better readability. For example:\n",
