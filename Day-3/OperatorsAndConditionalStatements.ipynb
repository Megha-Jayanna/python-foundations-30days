    "# Operators in Python\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators are used to perform mathematical operations. They include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `//` (floor division), `%` (modulus), and `**` (exponentiation).\n",
    "2. Comparison Operators: These operators are used to compare values and return a boolean result. They include `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to).\n",
    "3. Logical Operators: These operators are used to combine boolean expressions. They include `and` (logical AND), `or` (logical OR), and `not` (logical NOT).\n",
    "4. Assignment Operators: These operators are used to assign values to variables. They include `=` (simple assignment), `+=` (add and assign), `-=` (subtract and assign), `*=` (multiply and assign), `/=` (divide and assign), `//=` (floor divide and assign), `%=` (modulus and assign), and `**=` (exponentiate and assign).\n",
    "5. Bitwise Operators: These operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. They include `&` (bitwise AND), `|` (bitwise OR), `^` (bitwise XOR), `~` (bitwise NOT), `<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift).\n",
    "6. Identity Operators: These operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They include `is` (returns True if both operands refer to the same object) and `is not` (returns True if both operands do not refer to the same object).\n",
    "7. Membership Operators: These operators are used to test if a value is present in a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). They include `in` (returns True if the value is found in the sequence) and `not in` (returns True if the value is not found in the sequence)."

    "# Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "1. `if` statement: This is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "2. `elif` statement: This is used to specify a new condition to test if the previous conditions were false.\n",
    "3. `else` statement: This is used to execute a block of code if all the previous conditions were false.\n",
    "4. Nested `if` statements: This is when you have an `if` statement inside another `if` statement, allowing for more complex decision-making.\n",
    "5. Ternary operator: This is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement in a single line. It has the syntax `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`."
