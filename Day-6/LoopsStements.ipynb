    "# Statements in Python\n",
    "Statements are the building blocks of a Python program. They are instructions that the Python interpreter can execute. There are several types of statements in Python, including:\n",
    "1. Expression statements: These are statements that evaluate an expression and may have side effects. For example, `x = 5` is an expression statement that assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n",
    "2. Compound statements: These are statements that contain other statements. They include `if`, `for`, `while`, `try`, and `with` statements. For example, an `if` statement is a compound statement that contains a block of code that is executed if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "3. Control flow statements: These are statements that control the flow of execution in a program. They include `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements. For example, a `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while a `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. A `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing and is used when a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed.\n",
    "4. Function definitions: These are statements that define a function. They start with the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a list of parameters. For example, `def my_function():` is a function definition that defines a function named `my_function` that takes no parameters.\n",
    "5. Class definitions: These are statements that define a class. They start with the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. For example, `class MyClass:` is a class definition that defines a class named `MyClass`."

    "#Difference between if and match statement\n",
    "# The `if` statement is used for conditional branching based on boolean expressions. It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. For example:\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n",
    "# The `match` statement, introduced in Python 3.10, is used for pattern matching. It allows you to match a value against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches. It is more powerful than the `if` statement for certain use cases, such as when you want to match against complex data structures. For example:\n",
